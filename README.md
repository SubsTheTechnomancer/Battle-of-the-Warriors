# Battle-of-the-Warriors
A Turn Based RPG I made around Early to Mid 2018 as a Computer project because I was very bored.

## Updated in 2023
So there are so many warcrimes in this code that I need to refactor this. To keep it true to the original source I got a hold of
graphics.h (now very outdated) from <br> https://github.com/SagarGaniga/Graphics-Library/blob/master/graphics.h <br>
Compile the code with the command `g++ -L. game.cpp -o game.exe -lbgi -lgdi32 -lcomdlg32 -luuid -loleaut32 -lole32`.<br>
<br>
Also why did I even add a license to this repo wtf
